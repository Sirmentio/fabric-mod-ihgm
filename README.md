# I'm here, Get Moving

IHGM is a mod for Minecraft 1.19.x that does one simple thing for server owners.
Whenever there's no players online, IHGM will attempt, in a very ~~hacky~~ simple way,
to pause overworld's daytime ticks.

This basically means that when no one is online, time won't progress, meaning on small
24/7 servers, the days (and potentially difficulty) won't skyrocket. This is absolutely
great for survival Minecraft servers with small player counts and mixed activity.

# Compatibility
I have no idea!

But in seriousness, this *shouldn't* do anything, hopefully, but there might be some funkiness
with mods that rely on daytime ticks in some way. Caveat Emptor. This was tested on a 1.17.1 server,
so make of that what you will.

# Forge?
This mod is small (And CC0!) so you're more than welcome to
try and port it yourself.
